Project : Exploratory Data Analysis On Car Dataset
Objective: To explore and visualize the datasetâ€™s characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.


Steps:

Data Loading and Inspection:
Load the dataset into a DataFrame using pandas.
Inspect the first few rows and data types of the columns to understand the dataset structure and identify any necessary preprocessing steps.

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values by filling them with median values (or other methods as appropriate).
Check for data types and convert non-numeric columns if needed for analysis.

Feature Engineering:
Create new features if necessary, such as interaction terms, to enrich the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics to understand data distributions.
Correlation Matrix: Compute and visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numeric features.
Histograms: Visualize the distribution of numeric features.
Box Plots: Detect potential outliers and visualize the spread of the data.

Visualizations:
Heatmap of the correlation matrix to show relationships between features.
Histograms to illustrate the distribution of numeric features.
Box Plots to highlight outliers and the distribution of features.

Tools and Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
